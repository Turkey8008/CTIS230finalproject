            <div id="clickmain"><p >On early 2021, Russia began a major build-up in their military along the Ukraine border, followed by further build-ups in both Russia and Belarus. The following months consisted of Putin and other Russian officials challenging the legitimacy of Ukraine and also accusing the Ukrainian government of Russophobia. In early February of 2022, small-scale fighting in the Donbas region intensified, with Russia recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, two breakaway states from Ukraine, days later. Russian troops were then ordered into the Donbas region on a “peacekeeping mission” for these breakaway republics. On February 24, 2022, Putin announced a “special military operation” to “protect the people” of these breakaway states, and to “demilitarize and denazify” Ukraine. </p>

                <p >The invasion of Ukraine began later that day, with a full-scale assault on the Donbas region, along with missile strikes throughout the entirety of Ukraine. Multiple failed assassination attempts were also reportedly made on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. After the first weeks of the invasion, multiple experts on the war began to doubt that a quick resolution to the conflict was possible. </p>
