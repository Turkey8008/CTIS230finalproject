            <div id="clickmain"><p > In reaction to the war, the United States of America and the European Union have both imposed various economic sanctions on Russia. These sanctions have been intended to negatively impact the Russian economy while also limiting the negative factors on the citizens of these entities. However, negative effects in the United States and the European Union have been significant, with the sharp increase in gas prices within the United States being blamed on these sanctions by many. Along with responses from governments, many organizations and citizens in these nations have spoken out in defense of Ukraine, with sports organizations ousting athletes wearing pro-war symbols, citizens who have donated to Ukraine or protested publicly against Russia, along with citizens who have enlisted in Ukraine's Foreign Legion.</p>

                <p >Due to these responses from the world community, tensions between nations have substantially risen since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, with defense readiness condition levels being the closest to a Third World War as they have been since the Cuban Missile Crisis. While potentially considered distant by many people, the Russo-Ukrainian War has significant and long-term impacts on the entire world community, and will continue to even after a peace has been reached.</p>
