            <p class="salingerparagraph">Jerome David Salinger was born in Manhattan, New York on January 1, 1919, to Sol Salinger and Miriam Jillich. After attending public schools for his youth, he was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1936. He had also been the literary editor for the school's yearbook, <em>Crossed Sabres</em> (“J.D. Salinger”). After briefly attending Ursinus and Columbia University, where he published many short stories, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he was part of the Army Counterintelligence Corps (Frey). In the early years of the war, he continued writing, publishing several short stories. In 1944, he participated in D-Day, landing on Utah Beach. After this time, he had already written several chapters of The Catcher in the Rye, which were with him during the invasion. His company marched to Paris, where they stayed until fall, when they marched into Germany (Frey). The next year, he was hospitalized for “battle fatigue.” After the war, he briefly married Sylvia Welter, whom he had interrogated during the war (Frey). After the war, he became increasingly associated with <em>The New Yorker</em>, which published most of his works, many of which drew from experiences during his military service (“J.D. Salinger”). When <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> was first published in 1951, Salinger began drawing public attention, something that he vehemently detested, causing him to withdraw to a house in Cornish, New Hampshire, in 1953. In the house, there was a bunker, which was where Salinger spent the majority of his time, writing (Frey). Over the next decades, Salinger continued to write, with most of these works never seen by the public, along with having relations with several people, having three more marriages, with the final, with Colleen O'Neil, lasting until his death on January 27, 2010 (Frey).</p>
