            <div id="clickmain"><p>In 2010, tensions between Ukraine and Russia began to rise when Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych was inaugurated. Yanukovych had been a divisive figure in politics, with his policies being heralded to be an attempt to keep Ukraine as a “neutral state” between Russia and NATO. Political opponents of Yanukovych used claims of the president being overly friendly with Russian president Vladimir Putin and Russia, along with claims that the president had attempted to remove political opponents of his in an attempt to control the politics of Ukraine.</p> 

                <p>A series of protests called the “Revolution of Dignity” began when a change in proceedings occurred during Ukraine's entrance into the EU, ending their negotiations with the EU. These protests turned violent, with dozens of protesters being killed. Yanukovych continued to lose popularity, and on February 22nd, 2014, Yanukovych to Russia ahead of an impeachment vote, one that is extremely controversial and is still debated as to whether it was constitutional. Days later, Vladimir Putin mobilized troops into Crimea and southeast Ukraine, annexing the region on March 18th, 2014. The new Ukrainian government declared that Crimea was a territory temporarily occupied by Russia, along with quickly reopening negotiations and joining the EU. Russia then helped to fund and gave troops to separatist movements within Ukraine’s Donbas region, which is Ukraine’s easternmost region. However, a ceasefire was reached in 2015, ending the revolution. </p>
                    
                <p>This ceasefire ended the official war, but separatist groups within the Donbas region, particular those in the Luhansk and Donestsk oblasts of Ukraine, remained active up to the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
