            <h1><em> History of Russia and Ukraine</em></h1>

            <div class="centered"><img src="images/Soviet_Union_Administrative_Divisions_1989Revised.jpg" width=750 alt="Map of the USSR with individual regions" id="ussr" title="Soviet Administrative Map, 1989, in World History Commons, http://whc.rrchnm.org/soviet-administrative-map-1989"></div>


            <div id="clickmain"><p>In the 9th century, a group of Eastern Swedes known as Varangians settled within the area of Novgorod, a principality of modern-day Russia. This group formed the state of Rus’, ruled over by their leader, Rurik. After Rurik’s death, his relative, Oleg, conquered the area to the south of Rus’, including Kiev, with the nation being renamed to the Kievan Rus'. The Kievan Rus' continued to be led by Rurik's descendants, becoming a prosperous trading empire through its usage of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers for trade with the East, including the Byzantine Empire. Drawn to the wealth that Byzantine controlled, the Kievan Rus’ warred the Byzantines in a series of wars, concluding with trade treaties that favored the Rus’. With peace existing between the two nations, the Kievan Rus' existed peacefully for several centuries, with Byzantine influence within the nation causing for its Christianization. </p>

            <p>After these centuries of peace, the Kievan Rus' was experiencing disintegration in the 13th century due to political infighting. To exacerbate this issue, the Mongol Golden Horde arrived within the area, shattering the weakened state into three separate regions, which caused the fragmentation of the Rus’ nation into three distinct entities: Belarus’, Rus’, and what would be become known as Ukrainian. While southwestern Kievan Rus' was absorbed by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, southern Kievan Rus’ was fully controlled by the Tatars, as the Golden Horde was called, and northern Kievan Rus’, remained an independent republic, the Novgorod Republic, acting as an autonomous region for the Golden Horde. However, in the small trading outpost of Moscow, an empire was emerging. The Muscovites grew their nation, allying with the Golden Horde in order to conquer surrounding areas, further expanding the power and influence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. After some time, the Muscovites used their power to drive the Golden Horde out of present-day Russia and Ukraine, with help from princes from Mongol-controlled regions.  </p>
                
            <p>By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Moscow's ruler, Ivan III, claimed the title of “Tsar,” claiming to be the ruler of all of Rus’. Under Ivan III, the newly-formed Russia annexed the Novgorod Republic, continuing to expand throughout the region. Ivan III’s heir, Ivan IV, better known as “Ivan the Terrible,” continued to expand eastward, taking control of Mongol lands that would quickly become autonomous regions of the Cossacks. During Ivan the Terrible’s rule, mass reforms within Russian society occurred, along with attacks on neighboring regions. These actions proved to be too much for the Russian people, with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden attacking and devastating much of western Russian for its transgressions. The bloodline of Ivan IV fell into disarray, with multiple uprisings occurring after his death, with their leaders each claiming to be his son, rightful heir to the Russian throne. This instability caused for Russia to lose much land to its western neighbors, along with leading to the accession of the Romanov dynasty through the voting of a national assembly. Russia began to regain territory, with a war with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth causing for the acquisition of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River by the Russians, along with Kiev. Decades later, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was experiencing disintegration, with Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioning the state into three separate territories in the late 18th century. Ukrainian Cossacks, who had helped Russians in their wars against the Polish, now turned against the Russians in a number of small-scale rebellions. This caused for increasing sentiments of sectionalism and for an independent Ukraine within the region. </p>
            
            <p>In the early 20th century, communism began to gain support within Russia. With the many Russian casualties caused by World War I, with many Russians not being supplied weapons or clothing, Tsar Nicolas II Romanov lost popular support. Communists used this to foster a revolution in October of 1917, seizing control of Russia and killing the entire Romanov family to prevent the existence of a heir to the throne, creating the first communist nation. Over a century after its complete inclusion into Russia, Ukraine became one of the 15 Soviet Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union. However, after only 15 years within the Soviet Union, Ukraine’s allegiance was tested in the form of the Holodomor, a widespread famine that killed millions of Ukrainians. This famine was widespread throughout the Soviet Union; however, food was more concentrated within others areas of the USSR, with Ukraine experiencing the worst of the famine. </p>
              
            <p>After the betrayal of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which stated that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany would partition Poland and maintain peace with each other, by Nazi Germany and the subsequent invasion of the USSR, the Soviet Union helped the Allies defeat the Axis Powers. After World War II ended, the Cold War continued until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December of 1991. At this time, Ukraine became an independent nation.</p>
