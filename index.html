            <p id="clickintro"> The Russo-Ukrainian War is one of the many focuses of pop culture in the modern world. However, many people do not understand the basics of the war: where it is, how it began, and how it effects their daily lives. This informational website will answer these questions and many more like them in an attempt at objectivity towards the war.  </p>
            <p id="clickmain">Although this website will attempt impartiality, some information present may be outdated or wrong, meaning that you, the viewer, should not read this website as the complete truth. This information was compiled through information that itself may not have been gathered from first-hand accounts. Using other websites along with this one can help to crosscheck any questionable information provided in this website. Along with this, this website is referring to the “Russo-Ukrainian War” as the conflict which began on February 24th, 2022, and does not include the 2014 conflict which ended in a ceasefire.</p>
