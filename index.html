            <p class="intro">In his 1951 novel, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J. D. Salinger tells the story of Holden Caulfield, a psychologically unstable adolescent living in New York, who, due to various events throughout his lifetime, begins distrusting “phony” society (Salinger 3). This distrust and alienation from society leads to dire consequences in Holden's written life and Salinger's real one. Taking inspiration from his childhood and personal experiences during World War II, Salinger explores the subject of alienation and the loss of innocence throughout his novel, which captures the dialect of the time thoroughly.</p>

                    <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> by J.D. Salinger follows Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old suffering from survivor's guilt after his brother's death, since he is expelled from his boarding school, Pencey Prep. After being expelled, he goes to see his English teacher, Mr. Spencer, where he catches some illness which he struggles with for the rest of the book. After leaving the Spencer residence, he goes to his dormitory, where he interacts with his fellow classmates, including his roommate Stradlater, who tells Holden that he is going on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl whom Holden knew and appears to care about. After experiencing emotional distress, both due to Stradlater's date and his expulsion, he begins to hate his classmates because they are “phonies”, people who do things that are not truthful and shallow (52). After he leaves his former school, he catches a train to New York, where he intends to stay until Wednesday. After the train ride, he gets into a taxicab, where he asks the taxi driver what happens to the ducks on Central Park when the lake freezes, a figurative expression for how he feels at the moment, with the driver barely responding. After exiting the taxi, he checks into the Edmont Hotel, where, after spending some time in the hotel lounge, he heads up to his room. At this time, Holden, as an act of rebellion, buys some time with a prostitute named Sunny from the elevator worker, a pimp named Maurice. After she arrives, Holden begins to question his intended actions, ending up just wanting to talk to her, causing Sunny to storm out with the amount of money that was, according to Holden, agreed upon. Maurice then returns to Holden's room and punches him and takes an extra five dollars.</p><p class="noindent">The next morning, Holden calls Sally Hayes, a person with whom Holden has a romantic connection, along with referring to her as “the queen of all phonies” (124). After spending some time together, Holden begins ranting about society, causing Sally to leave, scared of and for Holden. After meeting an old roommate at a bar, Holden gets drunk and goes looking in Central Park for ducks, breaking a record that he had bought for his younger sister, Phoebe. He then goes to his home to see Phoebe, whom he talks to for a while before leaving to go stay with his old English teacher, Mr. Antolini. Holden begins to sleep after talking with a drunk Antolini, but he wakes up to find his teacher patting his head, which disturbs Holden and causes him to leave. In the morning, he goes to Phoebe's school to tell her to meet him for lunch, where he sees a curse word that he attempts to rub out, as he is afraid of a child seeing that and learning the meaning of the word. While waiting for Phoebe after sending her a message, Holden explores the Metropolitan Museum of Art where he becomes enraged after seeing another profane piece of graffiti. He then meets Phoebe in front of the museum, who arrives with a suitcase and begs for her to be allowed to go with him. After being talked out of leaving, Holden attempts to make Phoebe feel better by bringing her to a carnival, where she rides a carousel, with Holden experiencing happiness at the sight of her riding it, as it represents her innocence to him. The novel ends abruptly, hinting at an event where Holden has an emotional breakdown, causing him to go to the mental institution where he is narrating the story from.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Throughout <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, Salinger creates parallels between his life and Holden's. This is shown in multiple facets of the book, including the setting, New York, where Salinger resided. At the beginning of the book, Holden is expelled from Pencey Prep, (Salinger 2) paralleling Salinger being kicked out of private schools. Along with this, Holden's older brother, D.B, fought in World War II, paralleling Salinger's experience, along with being a writer mainly focused in short stories, which was Salinger's main medium as well (Wiegand 1). Nearing the end of the book, Holden begins wishing to go to a remote location and live as a recluse, (Salinger 131) which is something which Salinger attempts and succeeds in doing after writing this book (Frey). Through creating parallels to both Holden and D.B, Salinger helps the reader understand that this “vision of something so terrible that it cannot be communicated,” (Levine 2) alienation and the loss of innocence, is his own. In trying to make his struggle more understandable to the readers of the 1950s, he uses dialect which is a “true and authentic rendering of teenage colloquial speech” for the period (Costello 1). By making Holden more realistic and relatable through his speech, Salinger fully communicates his ideas through the text.</p>
                    <p class="noindent">Within J.D. Salinger's writing, there is a common theme: alienation or rejection by conformist society (Wiegand 2). This is explored in great detail in The Catcher in the Rye, with the entire life and future of Holden Caulfield jeopardized in the process of his internal battle with conformity. Through exploring the psychological turmoil which Caulfield struggles with, Salinger characterizes his inner self and struggle. To do this, he includes details in the book which parallel those from his real life. In his only interview before retreating to complete reclusion, Salinger stated, “My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book” (Crawford 4).</p>
